    <h2>Welcome to Coffee and Code</h2>
    <h3>Your local cafe</h3>
    <p>In April 2011 we opened our doors on Exmouth Market, intent on bringing to the neighbourhood the very best coffee possible. Sourcing, roasting and brewing great coffee lead to more, and since then, our Clerkenwell cafe has evolved into a thriving destination for coffee, food, beer and wine lovers alike

    The coffee was really good and the place itself was more than relaxed. I was so comfortable I didn't want to leave. I will definitely return.

    Food and coffee are both exceptional. As expected orange juice is the freshly sqeezed variety. You can't go wrong with the breakfast corn fritters or poached eggs with sourdough and tomato kasundi.
